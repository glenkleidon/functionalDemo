Demo of Functional Programming approach for Delphi

## Purpose
This repo has been created for the purposes of showing how an existing Delphi project can be refactored using some of the Functional principles.  Be Warned - this repo is a work in progress and at this stage, the code does not represent any true functional programming princpiles: it barely scratches the surface really.

## Applying the Crumbs
At this stage this repo and notes can at best be described as the crumbs of the functional programming approach.  The repo is largely inspired by a Functional programming principles course for C# I did on Plural Sight by [Vladimir Khorikov](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/vladimir-khorikov) 

As C# is in many ways the daughter of Delphi, it seems reasonable that this course could easily be applied to Delphi code.

The course which is proported to be about functional programming principles just in truth it only touches on some of the more significant components.  However this is actually fine as there are definite benefits for OO programming by adopting the approaches described in that course.

So I think that at this stage, this repo represents just the crumbs of functional programming princpiles and as time goes on, as my journey towards functional programming progresses, it will continue to adopt truly functional programming principles and be more representative of the title "Functional Programming"
