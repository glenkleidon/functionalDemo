# Functional Programming Demo

## Steps

### 1. Immutability.  Elements/variables should be immutable

     (a). remove public setters from the class
     (b). set the filename in the constructor
     (c). call set header directly ?  Is it really just getHeader when it loads the body and checks if the file exists??
     (d). remove Body property - enherently mutable Object of TString
